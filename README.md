# Ancestor Line Explorer

Use this application to load the direct ancestors of the person identified in the start profile (up to a given number of generations) from WikiTree and draw their family tree up to a specified tree level. People that appear more than once in the tree are marked with a coloured square. If the 'Connectors' checkbox is ticked, a tree line will not be extended to beyond a duplicate person if there is already a line containing this person. If a duplicate person is selected, all occurrences if it and the lines to them are highlighted.

The tree can be epanded and contracted as desired

People of interest can be identified, which will cause the lines to them to be highlighted.
